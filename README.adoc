= Potential Immutable.js Performance Regression

`src/benchmarks.js` measures performance of filtering an already sorted list of elements.
The list is 1 million items long, the predicate matches after the first 10 items (i.e. relatively early).

Thus, the following expectations arise:

* `filter` will be slow because it always needs to traverse the complete list
* `skipUntil` and `findIndex` should be:
** faster than `filter`
** both be of similar performance

These expectations hold true for 3.8.2 but *not* for 4.0.0-rc.12, *potentially indicating a regression*.
